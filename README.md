Neural Network Quantization on VGG16 Model

This repository contains an in-depth implementation of neural network quantization techniques on the VGG16 model, using the CIFAR-10 dataset as an example. Quantization is a model compression technique that reduces the precision of the weights and activations of a neural network, allowing for reduced model size, faster inference, and lower energy consumption—all while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy.

Overview

Quantization techniques aim to reduce the computational complexity of deep neural networks by representing weights and activations with lower precision, such as using int8 or other smaller data types. In this project, we focus on:

	•	k-means Quantization
	•	Quantization-Aware Training for k-means Quantization
	•	Linear Quantization
	•	Integer-Only Inference for Linear Quantization

The repository demonstrates how quantization can be applied to neural networks to improve performance, reduce memory usage, and achieve faster inference times while analyzing tradeoffs in accuracy.

Objectives

	•	Understand the Basics of Quantization: Learn the theory behind quantization and its impact on neural networks.
	•	Implement k-means Quantization: Apply k-means clustering to quantize weights into discrete values.
	•	Quantization-Aware Training: Perform training while accounting for the quantization error to improve post-quantization performance.
	•	Apply Linear Quantization: Reduce the precision of weights and activations using linear scaling.
	•	Integer-Only Inference: Perform inference using integer arithmetic, reducing the need for floating-point operations and improving hardware compatibility.
	•	Analyze Performance Improvements: Measure speedups and reduced memory consumption due to quantization, as well as accuracy tradeoffs.
	•	Compare Quantization Methods: Understand the differences and tradeoffs between k-means quantization and linear quantization.

Contents

This notebook is divided into several key sections:

	1.	k-means Quantization:
	•	Apply k-means clustering on weights of the VGG16 model to represent them with a reduced set of centroids.
	•	Evaluate the effect of k-means quantization on model accuracy and size.
	2.	Quantization-Aware Training for k-means Quantization:
	•	Retrain the VGG16 model while considering quantization errors.
	•	Fine-tune the model post-quantization to regain any lost accuracy.
	3.	Linear Quantization:
	•	Quantize weights and activations using linear scaling (from 32-bit to 8-bit precision).
	•	Evaluate performance and accuracy changes post-quantization.
	4.	Integer-Only Inference for Linear Quantization:
	•	Perform inference using integer-only arithmetic to optimize speed on hardware that lacks floating-point computation units.
	•	Analyze the tradeoffs between accuracy and inference speed.

Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. This dataset is automatically downloaded using torchvision.datasets.

Quantization Techniques

1. k-means Quantization

k-means quantization applies clustering on the network weights to represent them as a reduced set of centroids. This reduces the number of unique values, compressing the model.

2. Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)

Quantization-aware training retrains the model while simulating quantization during training. This helps the model adapt to quantization errors, improving post-quantization accuracy.

3. Linear Quantization

Linear quantization scales the weights and activations from full precision (32-bit) to lower precision (e.g., 8-bit). This method is simple and highly efficient for reducing both model size and computational cost.

4. Integer-Only Inference

Integer-only inference avoids floating-point calculations entirely during the inference phase, making it suitable for low-power devices or hardware optimized for integer operations.
